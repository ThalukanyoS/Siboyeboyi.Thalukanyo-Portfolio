                <p className="about">
                    I am Siboyeboyi Thalukanyo, A recent Graduate from the University of the Free State <br/>
                    I hold a Bachelors of Science degree in Information Technology Majoring in Computer Science<br/>
                    and Business Management. Through my studies I have gained considerable skilss in Information technology Field.
                    I love to create<br/> web apps(Front and back end Developer).
                    I want to be a Developer at SovTech because it is the type of <br/>
                    job where I will be able to use my knowledge and skills to solve challenging problems.<br/>
                    I love the fact that I will have a positive impact on SovTech clients by delivering website<br/>
                    that they will like and find very appealing. I have skills, qualities & a Degree that match the<br/>
                    job description. I love all SovTch Spex but the one attracted me was the Tech Spex. It Includes
                    <ol>
                        <li>Innovation</li>
                        <li>Change The World</li>
                        <li>Efficiency</li>
                        <li>Ideas</li>
                        <li>Exponential</li>
            
                    </ol>
                    I also support the statement of SovTech that says "SovTech don't believe that tech can't solve<br/>
                    everything and change the world,"So me working at SovTech means that I will be able <br/>
                    able to be Innovative, Change The world with the projects that I will develop under SovTech. <br/>
                    Again I will be able to work efficiently, meaning every energy that I will put on will be mostly equal<br/>
                    to my results. At SovTech I will grow my brainstorming skills and be able to solve problems with brilliant Ideas<br/>
                    One of the Imporatant part again is that at SovTech my growth will be Exponential because I will have the best of support<br/>
                    that I can ever get.
